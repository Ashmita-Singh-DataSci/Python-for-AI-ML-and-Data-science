Hey everyone, this repository contains everything from the basics in my learning journery in Data Science and AI-ML.
Starting from basics of python that ive explained in some detail with some rules at the beginning that a beginner would need to take care of.
Ive made it as simpler as i can, you're open to suggest improvements, i'll also be uploading new content, updating the repository.
This repo also contains basic exploration of libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
You're welcome to do any kind of exploration on your own. Thanks!
